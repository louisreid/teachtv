After finishing a day full of classes and having lunch, I would sit down to plan the next day's lessons and ask, \"What am I going to possibly do tomorrow?\". To me, this seemed like the only possible way to accomplish the monumental task ahead of me. However, after some more seasoning and tenderizing (at the hands of my students and other more experienced teachers), I realized that I was using the wrong recipe to cook up my lessons.\n\nThis is when I was turned on to Technique 6: Being with the End. This technique showed me that by framing an objective first, I could substitute the question, \"What am I going to do tomorrow?\" for, \"What will my students understand tomorrow?\"\n\nBegin with the End is an important technique because it gives real criteria against which you can objectively judge the success of your lessons. Instead of asking, \"Did we finish the activity?\", or \"Did students seem to want to do it or enjoy it?\", we can ask \"Did we reach our learning goal for today?\"\n\nAdopting this technique is the line of demarcation for my movement from the survival stage to mastery stage of teaching.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, follow me at: https://www.facebook.com/kaizenteaching",

     "description": "Technique 18 is about effectively checking for understanding. This technique teaches us how to gather data constantly and act on the data quickly. We should be seeking constant opportunities to assess what our students can do while we’re teaching and using that knowledge to inform what you do and how you do it. \n\nIt is easy to look at what happens in our classrooms through a descriptive lens; however, seeing students answers as data allows us to look at their responses neutrally, through an analytical framework, to assess answers, without allowing our own narrative of why they are correct or incorrect to cloud our judgement of what is happening.\n\nPart 1 is about Gathering Data."

Responding to the data we collect will not be simple to do at first, but over time it will become so ingrained in us, as to become second nature, intuitive. \n\n“Faithfully pursuing a course over enough time, we will eventually be rewarded with intuitive powers. That whole living, breathing, changing beast that is our field will become internalized and live within us. Possessing even a part of such power will instantly separate us from all of the others who find themselves overwhelmed and straining to simplify what is inherently complex. We will be able to respond faster and more effectively than others. What seemed chaotic to us before will now seem to be simply a fluid situation with a particular dynamic that we have a feel for and can handle with relative ease.”\n\nRobert, Greene. “Mastery\"",

Procedures teach students responsible skills they can use in school and in life. Technique 20, Exit Ticket, is both a fantastic classroom procedure & life skill. This technique describes the procedure for dismissal at the end of the period or day. It involves students lining up at the door in an orderly fashion, and the teacher asking one or a series of simple short questions before students leave.\n\nThis technique accomplishes two things at once. First, it allows teacher to gather important information about student understanding, which provides critical insight and helps in designing the next day's lesson. Second, it trains students to line up quietly at the back of the classroom and prepare for dismissal by the teacher, only after the teacher has check the classroom (chair pushed in, papers cleaned up...etc), and not the bell.",

    "description": "The “Vegas” strategy is a technique that adds a little bit of “umph” to a day’s lesson. However, its soul purpose is not just for sparkle or laughs, it is used to reinforce a learning objective of that day. Vegas can be a when students act out an action verb they just learned, singing the long division song, or having charades to see who best acts out they day’s vocabulary word. These are just a few examples, but they are perfect illustrations of how a little bit of “production” in the classroom and can go a long way in terms of reinforcing material and hitting a concept home. This strategy allows students to engage and physically relate the material they are learning to themselves and the world around them.\nThis type of learning strategy asks students to take it beyond the pages and become physically, visually, even verbally connected to the subject. Vegas is also connected to retrieval and factors that affect it. There are multiple factors that affect retrieval and the Vegas strategy touches on a few of these. First, there is distinctiveness. This technique presents information in a way that is distinct and memorable, therefore making retrieval easier. It is also related to multiple connections with existing knowledge. The Vegas strategy gets students to create their own connection through visual kinesthetic activities that relate to the subject matter in some way. The more connections a student can establish, the more likely they will be able to retrieve the learned information.",

     "description": "Being prepared helps create the proper environment for enhancing student growth. Just as a coach would never allow a player to practice without their helmet or shoes, so too should a teacher never allow students to begin class without all the materials they need. This means teachers need to be clear about what students need, how long they have to get it, and regularly use consequences for not having the materials.\n\nThis of this preparation as gathering the ingredients to a recipe. If all of the ingredients are not present, you can still cook, but something will always be missing."
