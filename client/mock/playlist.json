    "description": "When I started teaching, I was in survival mode. After finishing a day full of classes and having lunch, I would sit down to plan the next day's lessons and ask, \"What am I going to possibly do tomorrow?\". To me, this seemed like the only possible way to accomplish the monumental task ahead of me. However, after some more seasoning and tenderizing (at the hands of my students and other more experienced teachers), I realized that I was using the wrong recipe to cook up my lessons.\n\nThis is when I was turned on to Technique 6: Being with the End. This technique showed me that by framing an objective first, I could substitute the question, \"What am I going to do tomorrow?\" for, \"What will my students understand tomorrow?\"\n\nBegin with the End is an important technique because it gives real criteria against which you can objectively judge the success of your lessons. Instead of asking, \"Did we finish the activity?\", or \"Did students seem to want to do it or enjoy it?\", we can ask \"Did we reach our learning goal for today?\"\n\nAdopting this technique is the line of demarcation for my movement from the survival stage to mastery stage of teaching.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, follow me at: https://www.facebook.com/kaizenteaching",

Practicing the Double Plan is an excellent habit to form and will help you establish a routine that helps you understand your students' perspective and any potential flaws in your activities.",

    "description": "Technique 11 focuses on the \"how\" you study, an aspect of lesson planning that can often be overlooked. When you plan, make sure that the physical environment you will be using is able to support the learning objectives of your activities. \n\nAs a traveling teacher, this task sometimes seems impossible. Moving from one class to another, I am constantly presented with classroom layouts that the homeroom teacher prefers or seating arrangements that were optimized for the lesson before mine. \n\nIt is important to take time and plan the physical layout of students and desks in the classroom (as well as the time needed to carry out the movement of students and desks into this layout), into your lesson; then, as carefully, quietly, and calmly as possible implement it.",

That whole living, breathing, changing beast that is our field will become internalized and live within us. Possessing even a part of such power will instantly separate us from all of the others who find themselves overwhelmed and straining to simplify what is inherently complex. We will be able to respond faster and more effectively than others.

Procedures teach students responsible skills they can use in school and in life. Technique 20, Exit Ticket, is both a fantastic classroom procedure & life skill. This technique describes the procedure for dismissal at the end of the period or day. It involves students lining up at the door in an orderly fashion, and the teacher asking one or a series of simple short questions before students leave.\n\nThis technique accomplishes two things at once. First, it allows teacher to gather important information about student understanding, which provides critical insight and helps in designing the next day's lesson. Second, it trains students to line up quietly at the back of the classroom and prepare for dismissal by the teacher, only after the teacher has check the classroom (chair pushed in, papers cleaned up...etc), and not the bell.",

    "description": "Technique 21: Take a Stand, asks students to actively make judgement about their peers' answers. This technique allows the teacher to assess the students' understanding (through questioning how and why they have come to their conclusion) and thereby pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of their instruction.\n\nWhen you begin to implement this technique, you will have to think about all of the various steps and actions involved, things may feel awkward at first. Rest assured, with repetition and practice, you (and the participating students) will quickly begin to function almost automatically.\n\nNever forget, when you make one classroom skill automatic, you and your students are freed up to focus on a higher one.",

With time to reflect and begin turning thoughts into words, I’d have the best chance of being ready to participate and, ideally, at some level of depth, because my ideas would be better and I would be more confident in them.

    "description": "The “Vegas” strategy is a technique that adds a little bit of “umph” to a day’s lesson. However, its soul purpose is not just for sparkle or laughs, it is used to reinforce a learning objective of that day. Vegas can be a when students act out an action verb they just learned, singing the long division song, or having charades to see who best acts out they day’s vocabulary word. These are just a few examples, but they are perfect illustrations of how a little bit of “production” in the classroom and can go a long way in terms of reinforcing material and hitting a concept home. This strategy allows students to engage and physically relate the material they are learning to themselves and the world around them.\nThis type of learning strategy asks students to take it beyond the pages and become physically, visually, even verbally connected to the subject. Vegas is also connected to retrieval and factors that affect it. There are multiple factors that affect retrieval and the Vegas strategy touches on a few of these. First, there is distinctiveness. This technique presents information in a way that is distinct and memorable, therefore making retrieval easier. It is also related to multiple connections with existing knowledge. The Vegas strategy gets students to create their own connection through visual kinesthetic activities that relate to the subject matter in some way. The more connections a student can establish, the more likely they will be able to retrieve the learned information.",

    "description": "Students spend a tremendous amount of time on transitions – moving from place to place or activity to activity -- and this is time that they are not learning. Teachers should make sure that students learn, practice, and master procedures – like how to line up, walk from class-to-class, or pass out papers. \n\nTo do this, teachers must break down procedures and map out the one right way to do them. One effective way to do this is to scaffold the transitions, teaching procedures step-by-step. It may seem like a waste of time or something for their homeroom teachers to do, but it is an investment and one that can pay off for months or years to come, depending on how long you teach. \n\nI have an entire school's worth of students (800ish) who can be settled down just by calling out a few letters because I have invested the time in teaching and re-teaching my transition prompts.",

Students work hard at completing assignments and projects in school; however, often, these are seen only by the teacher, graded and returned to the student. Sometimes, the work was posted on a classroom wall or in a school hallway. Many teachers kept portfolios of student work for report card conferences, and the rare teacher taught students how to build their own portfolios from their work. What a joy it would be if students felt their work was something more than a piece of paper to be put in a big blue bin at the end of the year. \n\nIt is possible for digital portfolios to be truly valuable to both teachers and students, by providing insight into not only what students created, but also how and why. Teachers should understand that by capturing student learning progress and performance in the moment we are able to tap in to the true power of portfolios, which lies in revisiting the materials.\n\nBy requiring a binder your students will have an organized system to store, organize, and recall what they’ve learned. This video technique will help you understand my favorite way for keeping track of students materials.",

    "description": "One of the best skills I have ever learned - and it is a shame I only learned it as an adult - is how to be a good member of an audience, whether that be an audience of 1 or 100. Learning how to listen well is equally as important as learning how to speak well.\n\nIf you aspire create good conversationalists, teach students to be attentive listeners. To be interesting, students have to be interested. \n\nDale Carnegie says, \"Ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments. Remember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems. A person's toothache means more to that person than a famine in China which kills a million people. [...] Think of that the next time you start a conversation.\"\n\nThis technique, SLANT offers a simple way to start your students off on the right path to becoming good listeners.",

    "description": "Technique 34, Seat Signals, helps teachers avoid disrupting their lessons by having students use nonverbal seat signals for certain requests. When teachers allow the use of seat signals, students can non-verbally ask to use the bathroom, request a pencil during a lesson, or receive a tissue without interrupting the teacher’s train of thought. \n\nEvidence says that seat signals are a great way to produce an efficient classroom environment. Time is always a factor in a classroom and unrelated questions during a lecture are things that could sometimes distract the whole class. \n\nOne of the main things that can cause information to get stopped at working memory (before being stored in long-term memory) is interference. Interference is when someone or something distracts a student while he/she is concentrated on something else. When students are using silent and non-disturbing motions to ask common questions that could interrupt lecture, the amount of information going into long term memory increases.",

As a teacher you have to make 100 percent the standard, not the goal. It means that what you request gets done and what you request is moving your classroom towards maximum efficiency. \n\nThe technique is very involved and has a lot of value, so I wanted to break it up into more manageable chunks.

    "description": "Technique 40: SWEAT THE DETAILS – In the famous “broken windows” theory, if we erase the graffiti, fix broken windows, etc.\nthen people will perceive their environment as orderly and safe and will work to preserve that. Even the smallest of details can signal\nthe expectations for behavior. In the classroom, if we create order, students will receive the message that disruptions are not permitted here. Clean up clutter, keep desk rows tidy and hats off and you will decrease the likelihood that students see disruption as an option.",

    "description": "Technique 42: NO WARNINGS – Too often, teachers give a warning when addressing a student’s behavior. However, giving a\nwarning is not taking action. Warnings tell students that misbehavior is tolerated a few times first. This does not mean that a consequence needs to be given every time a student does not meet your expectations. As mentioned earlier, consequences are\noverused and teachers can respond by breaking down the directive (WHAT TO DO) or having students try again (DO IT AGAIN).\n\nHowever, when it is time to deliver a consequence, teachers should have a scaled system of incrementally larger consequences. For example, first have a student repeat an action more appropriately, then require him to apologize, next take away a small privilege, then take away an entire privilege and make a phone call home. While doing this, be calm and be private.",
